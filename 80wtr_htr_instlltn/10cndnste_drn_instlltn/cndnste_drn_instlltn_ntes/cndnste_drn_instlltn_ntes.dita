    <title>Condensate Drain Installation Notes</title>
    <conbody>
        <ol id="ol_ptc_cgs_gbb">
            <li>The condensate drains from the water heaterâ€™s covered by this instruction have PH
                levels between 4.3 and 5.0. Install a commercially available neutralizing kit if
                required by local codes. Lower PH levels are acidic. Do not connect a metal
                condensate drain line, such as copper pipe, to the water heater for this
                reason.</li>
            <li>The field installed condensate drain line must not be less than 1/2 inch PVC in
                size.</li>
            <li>The exhaust elbow has a built in condensate trap. Do not install an additional trap
                in the condensate drain piping. Do not remove, modify or alter the factory
                condensate trap.</li>
