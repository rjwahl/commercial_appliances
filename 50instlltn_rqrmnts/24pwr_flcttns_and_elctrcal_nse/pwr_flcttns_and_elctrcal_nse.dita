    <title>Power Fluctuations and Electrical Noise</title>
    <shortdesc/>
    <conbody>
        <p id="p_lw2_m5v_1bb">The water heaterâ€™s control system requires a source of stable clean
            electricity for proper operation. Connecting the water heater to a branch circuit that
            is subject to fluctuations in voltage level or electrical line noise such as EMI
            (electro magnetic interference) or RFI (radio frequency interference) may cause erratic
            control system operation and malfunction. </p>
        <p id="p_mw2_m5v_1bb">A high quality power supply filter/suppressor must be installed if the
            above conditions exist. Call the technical support phone number listed on the back cover
            of this manual or contact a local power filter/suppressor supplier for more information. </p>
        <note>Malfunctions caused by the power supply and costs to install power supply filters are
            not covered under the limited warranty. See Commercial Water Heater Limited Warranty
            (page 76).</note>
