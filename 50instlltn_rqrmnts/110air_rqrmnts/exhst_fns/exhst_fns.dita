    <title>Exhaust Fans</title>
    <shortdesc/>
    <conbody>
        <p>Where exhaust fans are installed, additional air shall be provided to replace the
            exhausted air. When an exhaust fan is installed in the same space with a water heater,
            sufficient openings to provide fresh air must be provided that accommodate the
            requirements for all appliances in the room and the exhaust fan. Undersized openings
            will cause air to be drawn into the room through the water heaterâ€™s vent system causing
            poor combustion. Sooting, serious damage to the water heater, and the risk of fire or
            explosion may result. It can also create a risk of asphyxiation.</p>
